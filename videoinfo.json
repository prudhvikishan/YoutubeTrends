        "description": "Originally I wanted to do every boyfriend turn the skin would change but I underestimated how low in turns this song would have but even so I still have like a lot of clips leftover which I had no intention of going to waste. It's kinda of ironic when I literally stated that in my previous video but it was my fault for checking so I could only settle with this instead. Once again I still want people to know that I did use a bot to keep things well sync because I don't intend on hiding that fact since I wanted to make this video as a fun viewing experience while delivering people exposure of new skin mods out there. I have to admit compared to most I think week 2 is underrated which is the reason why I wanted to make a video of it before I forget it since I did skip it like two songs ago. Overall, this song was much easier to do since most mods came with a Girlfriend and Boyfriend skin.\n\nMods used in this video:\nMain Website for these mods comes from GameBanana\n\nOMORI MOD (Update: Bug Spray)\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/14222\n\nKokichi + Nagito as Spooky kids\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/188532\n\nSpookiez, But they're humanoid\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184827\n\nZim, Gir, and MiniMoose over Skid and Pump\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187577\n\nFamily Night Funkin Modpack\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184321\n\nMCYT MODPACK\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/download/14119\n\nSkid And Pump Skin Playable\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/183972\n\nLila over Daddy Dearest\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/188959\n\nGumball and Darwin over Spooky Kids\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190432\n\nElegant Night Dancin' Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/download/16246\n\nThe Angry Video Game Nerd over Boyfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/191014\n\nThe Pelones \"Pelito\" replaces BF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184485\n\nGarfield With beta bfcar and also color correction\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/186782\n\nMarina Over GF (Splatoon)\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187733\n\nKaede Akamatsu GF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188879\n\n2B / Friday Night Funkin' Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184460\n\nShuichi Saihara BF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187184\n\nPrincess Peach as Girlfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184627\n\nRitz over GF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190929\n\nHoloNight Funkin' RETURNS!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/16817\n\n►Follow Me!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PrizMatex\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n#FridayNightFunkin\u200b\u200b\u200b’",

          "description": "Originally I wanted to do every boyfriend turn the skin would change but I underestimated how low in turns this song would have but even so I still have like a lot of clips leftover which I had no intention of going to waste. It's kinda of ironic when I literally stated that in my previous video but it was my fault for checking so I could only settle with this instead. Once again I still want people to know that I did use a bot to keep things well sync because I don't intend on hiding that fact since I wanted to make this video as a fun viewing experience while delivering people exposure of new skin mods out there. I have to admit compared to most I think week 2 is underrated which is the reason why I wanted to make a video of it before I forget it since I did skip it like two songs ago. Overall, this song was much easier to do since most mods came with a Girlfriend and Boyfriend skin.\n\nMods used in this video:\nMain Website for these mods comes from GameBanana\n\nOMORI MOD (Update: Bug Spray)\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/14222\n\nKokichi + Nagito as Spooky kids\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/188532\n\nSpookiez, But they're humanoid\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184827\n\nZim, Gir, and MiniMoose over Skid and Pump\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187577\n\nFamily Night Funkin Modpack\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184321\n\nMCYT MODPACK\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/download/14119\n\nSkid And Pump Skin Playable\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/183972\n\nLila over Daddy Dearest\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/188959\n\nGumball and Darwin over Spooky Kids\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190432\n\nElegant Night Dancin' Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/download/16246\n\nThe Angry Video Game Nerd over Boyfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/191014\n\nThe Pelones \"Pelito\" replaces BF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184485\n\nGarfield With beta bfcar and also color correction\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/186782\n\nMarina Over GF (Splatoon)\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187733\n\nKaede Akamatsu GF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/188879\n\n2B / Friday Night Funkin' Mod\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184460\n\nShuichi Saihara BF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/187184\n\nPrincess Peach as Girlfriend\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/184627\n\nRitz over GF\nhttps://gamebanana.com/skins/download/190929\n\nHoloNight Funkin' RETURNS!\nhttps://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/16817\n\n►Follow Me!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PrizMatex\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n#FridayNightFunkin\u200b\u200b\u200b’"

There aren't as many unique mom skins out there which is why the skins don't change per turn and also looking at my previous video I felt kinda bad that we barely got to witness some gameplay from some of them. Once again I still want people to know that I did use a bot to keep things well sync because I don't intend on hiding that fact since I wanted to make this video as a fun viewing experience while delivering people exposure of new skin mods out there. I guess M.I.L.F was a little harder to handle since there a were a few missed notes but I'm okay with that since it doesn't break the flow of music. That Lady Dimitrescu mod was my personal favorite that I gave her the best part of the song.

        "description": "DMX has died. The rapper turned 50 in December. His death follows a heart attack he suffered, which was triggered by a drug overdose. Amid DMX’s hospitalization, a rep for his family told ET that he was in a medical state from which they do not think he will recover. On Monday, a vigil was held by the Ruff Ryders to the Rescue Foundation outside of DMX’s hospital. The ‘Party Up’ performer was nominated for three GRAMMY awards, and he won Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist at the American Music Awards in 2000.\n\nExclusives from #ETonline :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQwITQ__CeH2Y_7g2xeiNDa0vQsROQQgv",

          "title": "DMX Dead at 50",
          "description": "DMX has died. The rapper turned 50 in December. His death follows a heart attack he suffered, which was triggered by a drug overdose. Amid DMX’s hospitalization, a rep for his family told ET that he was in a medical state from which they do not think he will recover. On Monday, a vigil was held by the Ruff Ryders to the Rescue Foundation outside of DMX’s hospital. The ‘Party Up’ performer was nominated for three GRAMMY awards, and he won Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist at the American Music Awards in 2000.\n\nExclusives from #ETonline :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQwITQ__CeH2Y_7g2xeiNDa0vQsROQQgv"

        "description": "Yes, you read the title right! Bailey and I are splitting up! If y’all follow our social media, you know that we are GRADUATING from Baylor in May, and Bailey is now engaged (this video was filmed two weeks ago) with a wedding planned for later this year, which means... WE WON'T BE LIVING TOGETHER ANYMORE!! Be sure to click the video to hear all the juicy details of what we will be doing!\n\nBe sure to follow us on Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/BrooklynAndBailey\nAlso, shop our LND Mascara and NEW collection of Sweaters, Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Jewelry/Hair Accessories and MORE! (they sell SO FAST!) https://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com\n\nWe promised a quick proposal-related video for today, but there were miscommunication issues with the editor. The video will be done soon, and a longer BTS video about the proposal lead up  come the week after that!\n\nSo after our #college #graduation, Bailey will be staying in Waco for the next year while Asa finishes up college. She'll also be adding a new baby puppy, and more about that soon! Bailey will also work for our family business, splitting time between Waco and Dallas working on creative and operations for our own next HUGE project... meanwhile, I’ll be heading to Utah and taking additional professional certification courses for the same project!! I am SO excited to return to Utah near our huge extended family, get reacquainted with old friends from elementary school and junior high, and make new friends.\n\nI am sure a lot of y’all are asking this question... HOW will you keep up with your YouTube channel and videos living seperate???\n\nBailey and I commit today to KEEP PUTTING OUT WEEKLY CONTENT for y'all! We'll bulk film when we travel to see each other, which will be fairly often, and in the off weeks... you'll get independent videos from us and what we are doing in our own lives.

          "description": "Yes, you read the title right! Bailey and I are splitting up! If y’all follow our social media, you know that we are GRADUATING from Baylor in May, and Bailey is now engaged (this video was filmed two weeks ago) with a wedding planned for later this year, which means... WE WONT BE LIVING TOGETHER ANYMORE!! Be sure to click the video to hear all the juicy details of what we will be doing!\n\nBe sure to follow us on Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/BrooklynAndBailey\nAlso, shop our LND Mascara and NEW collection of Sweaters, Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Jewelry/Hair Accessories and MORE! (they sell SO FAST!)https://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com\n\nWe promised a quick proposal-related video for today, but there were miscommunication issues with the editor. The video will be done soon, and a longer BTS video about the proposal lead up  come the week after that!\n\nSo after our #college #graduation, Bailey will be staying in Waco for the next year while Asa finishes up college. She'll also be adding a new baby puppy, and more about that soon! Bailey will also work for our family business, splitting time between Waco and Dallas working on creative and operations for our own next HUGE project... meanwhile, I’ll be heading to Utah and taking additional professional certification courses for the same project!! I am SO excited to return to Utah near our huge extended family, get reacquainted with old friends from elementary school and junior high, and make new friends.\n\nI am sure a lot of y’all are asking this question... HOW will you keep up with your YouTube channel and videos living seperate???\n\nBailey and I commit today to KEEP PUTTING OUT WEEKLY CONTENT for y'all! We'll bulk film when we travel to see each other, which will be fairly often, and in the off weeks... you'll get independent videos from us and what we are doing in our own lives. Bailey's videos will likely be wedding prep related in the near future, and mine will be likely be about this new project and navigating the dating game as well as similar content as we've always uploaded.\n\nWe are SO EXCITED for our separate journeys to start, yet super sad that we won't be together as much...

First, you have to get cobblestone to turn into pebbles. These can be thrown at mobs to stun them so you can mine them. After you mine three of a mob, you can turn them into a pickaxe. The chicken pickaxe lets you float to the ground instead of falling, while the sheep pickaxe drops wool everytime you mine. The villager pickaxe gives you Hero of the Village and amazing trades and the spider pickaxe even lets you climb walls. Of course, as you advance, you need stronger materials to stun mobs. While pebbles may work on passive mobs, coal is needed for neutral mobs, iron for hostile mobs, and even diamond for some of the strongest mobs. These stronger mobs include the Iron Golem, whose pickaxe launches whatever you attack, and the Ravager, whose pickaxe has a roar attack. Even the Ender Dragon can be turned into a pickaxe, which will mine any blocks you walk towards. Which pickaxe was your favorite?

First, you have to get cobblestone to turn into pebbles. These can be thrown at mobs to stun them so you can mine them. After you mine three of a mob, you can turn them into a pickaxe. The chicken pickaxe lets you float to the ground instead of falling, while the sheep pickaxe drops wool everytime you mine. The villager pickaxe gives you Hero of the Village and amazing trades and the spider pickaxe even lets you climb walls. Of course, as you advance, you need stronger materials to stun mobs. While pebbles may work on passive mobs, coal is needed for neutral mobs, iron for hostile mobs, and even diamond for some of the strongest mobs. These stronger mobs include the Iron Golem, whose pickaxe launches whatever you attack, and the Ravager, whose pickaxe has a roar attack. Even the Ender Dragon can be turned into a pickaxe, which will mine any blocks you walk towards. Which pickaxe was your favorite?

This was absolutely the funniest video ever.\n\nFollow my socials \nTwitter/Instagram: @GeorgeNotFound\n\nMerch: https://georgenotfound.shop\n\nDream: @Dream \nSapnap: @Sapnap \nKarl: @Karl \n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.14/1.15/1.16 challenge that we have decided to try.\n\nMy friends can use whatever they want to try and make me laugh... Dream coded a bunch of super random mods into Minecraft and I had no idea what they were. We have a plugin that allows them to put custom images onto maps which they can place into item frames so they can bring any image into Minecraft! This was super fun and crazy awesome!\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin"

Keep em coming for future video ideas.\n\nGet your AMONG US are Hats skinpack!  https://cutt.ly/AmongUsAreHats\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO Comments to Crafting  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCExVkTyx3krvhmJjpFhb3dg?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nGet your They Are AMONG US skinpack! http://bit.ly/TheyAreAmongUs\nLogdotzip Games & Skinpacks here! https://cutt.ly/LogdotzipGames\nBecome a MEMBER today! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D-GCxeE69hCUmRwISXABw/join\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nThis is Minecraft but you can mine mobs. First, you have to get cobblestone to turn into pebbles. These can be thrown at mobs to stun them so you can mine them. After you mine three of a mob, you can turn them into a pickaxe. The chicken pickaxe lets you float to the ground instead of falling, while the sheep pickaxe drops wool everytime you mine. The villager pickaxe gives you Hero of the Village and amazing trades and the spider pickaxe even lets you climb walls. Of course, as you advance, you need stronger materials to stun mobs. While pebbles may work on passive mobs, coal is needed for neutral mobs, iron for hostile mobs, and even diamond for some of the strongest mobs. These stronger mobs include the Iron Golem, whose pickaxe launches whatever you attack, and the Ravager, whose pickaxe has a roar attack. Even the Ender Dragon can be turned into a pickaxe, which will mine any blocks you walk towards. Which pickaxe was your favorite?

First, you have to get cobblestone to turn into pebbles. These can be thrown at mobs to stun them so you can mine them. After you mine three of a mob, you can turn them into a pickaxe. The chicken pickaxe lets you float to the ground instead of falling, while the sheep pickaxe drops wool everytime you mine. The villager pickaxe gives you Hero of the Village and amazing trades and the spider pickaxe even lets you climb walls. Of course, as you advance, you need stronger materials to stun mobs. While pebbles may work on passive mobs, coal is needed for neutral mobs, iron for hostile mobs, and even diamond for some of the strongest mobs. These stronger mobs include the Iron Golem, whose pickaxe launches whatever you attack, and the Ravager, whose pickaxe has a roar attack. Even the Ender Dragon can be turned into a pickaxe, which will mine any blocks you walk towards. Which pickaxe was your favorite?
