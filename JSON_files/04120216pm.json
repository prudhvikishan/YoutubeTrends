        "description": "Watch as Asa PROPOSES to Bailey after they dated for over four years! He planned this all on his own, with some covert help from Brooklyn, family and friends. Bailey had no idea. What was your favorite part of the proposal? SUBSCRIBE and COMMENT BELOW!\n\n✅ Here is the ring Asa chose for Bailey from James Allen: 👉🏻 https://bit.ly/3gacwM5\n\n✅ Be sure to follow us on Instagram to see MORE PROPOSAL PHOTOS and Stories! 👉🏻 https://www.instagram.com/BrooklynAndBailey\n\nI met Asa met five years ago WAY BACK in 2016 when I was only 16 and he was 15. I didn’t know it then, but I had just met my future husband! It took a year of him pursuing me, and me constantly putting him in the FRIEND ZONE, before I realized what a catch he really was! On Feb 25, 2017, Asa and I officially started dating, ending the day with my very first kiss! You can watch that video, HERE: https://youtu.be/FsI8KtveD3A (y’all prob know that story😉)\n\nIn the beginning of this proposal video, there is a small outtake taken when Brooklyn and I were filming our music video for Simple Things in May, 2017. In that moment, Brooklyn and my mom had put Asa up to the task of pranking me with a fake wedding ring and proposal! Little did I know then that four years later Asa would be the one to OFFICIALLY propose to me... and I wouldn't have it ANY. OTHER. WAY! \n\nAs Asa walked me out to where he planned to propose, I started bawling my eyes out when I figured out what was going on... I literally had NO clue! The date 4/3/21 will forever be a day to remember for the both of us.❤️ It might seem small to you, but it was like even the world was counting down for us! \n\nI’m so glad I got to say YES to my forever!

          "description": "Watch as Asa PROPOSES to Bailey after they dated for over four years! He planned this all on his own, with some covert help from Brooklyn, family and friends. Bailey had no idea. What was your favorite part of the proposal? SUBSCRIBE and COMMENT BELOW!\n\n✅ Here is the ring Asa chose for Bailey from James Allen: 👉🏻 https://bit.ly/3gacwM5\n\n✅ Be sure to follow us on Instagram to see MORE PROPOSAL PHOTOS and Stories! 👉🏻 https://www.instagram.com/BrooklynAndBailey\n\nI met Asa met five years ago WAY BACK in 2016 when I was only 16 and he was 15. I didn’t know it then, but I had just met my future husband! It took a year of him pursuing me, and me constantly putting him in the FRIEND ZONE, before I realized what a catch he really was! On Feb 25, 2017, Asa and I officially started dating, ending the day with my very first kiss! You can watch that video, HERE: https://youtu.be/FsI8KtveD3A (y’all prob know that story😉)\n\nIn the beginning of this proposal video, there is a small outtake taken when Brooklyn and I were filming our music video for Simple Things in May, 2017. In that moment, Brooklyn and my mom had put Asa up to the task of pranking me with a fake wedding ring and proposal! Little did I know then that four years later Asa would be the one to OFFICIALLY propose to me... and I wouldn't have it ANY. OTHER. WAY! \n\nAs Asa walked me out to where he planned to propose, I started bawling my eyes out when I figured out what was going on... I literally had NO clue! The date 4/3/21 will forever be a day to remember for the both of us.❤️ It might seem small to you, but it was like even the world was counting down for us! \n\nI’m so glad I got to say YES to my forever!

        "description": "F9\nFast is back June 25.\nhttp://www.thefastsaga.com/\n\nNo matter how fast you are, no one outruns their past. \n\nF9 is the ninth chapter in the Fast & Furious Saga, which has endured for two decades and has earned more than $5 billion around the world.  \n\nVin Diesel’s Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he’s going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they’ve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom’s forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, the upcoming The Suicide Squad). \n\nF9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe—from London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tbilisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.  \n\nThe film stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. F9 also features Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B as new franchise character Leysa, a woman with a connection to Dom’s past, and a cameo by Reggaeton sensation Ozuna.  \n\nF9 is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend and Samantha Vincent.  www.thefastsaga.com",

When Scott Ward (Dave Bautista), a former zombie war hero who’s now flipping burgers on the outskirts of the town he now calls home, is approached by casino boss Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada), it’s with the ultimate proposition: break into the zombie-infested quarantine zone to retrieve $200 million sitting in a vault beneath the strip before the city is nuked by the government in 32 hours. With little left to lose, Ward takes on the challenge, assembling a ragtag team of experts for the heist. With a ticking clock, a notoriously impenetrable vault, and a smarter, faster horde of Alpha zombies closing in, only one thing’s for certain in the greatest heist ever attempted: survivors take all.\n\nStarring Dave Bautista, Ella Purnell, Omari Hardwick, Ana de la Reguera, Theo Rossi, Matthias Schweighöfer, Nora Arnezeder, Hiroyuki Sanada, Tig Notaro, Raúl Castillo, Huma Qureshi, Samantha Win, Michael Cassidy, Richard Cetrone, and Garret Dillahunt.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with 204 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.\n\nLyndsey McKenna | April 14, 2021\nA few years ago, some of us on the NPR Music team stumbled upon a copy of Demi Lovato's 2013 book, Staying Strong: 365 Days A Year. Reading Lovato's heartfelt daily reflections became a workday habit; her transparency and vulnerability made us ardent admirers who wanted nothing but the very best for Demi.\n\nWe made it our mission to get Demi to the Tiny Desk, and though the pandemic had other plans, Lovato's Tiny Desk (home) concert was worth the wait. Recorded on a sunny spring day in her Los Angeles backyard, Lovato begins with a moving rendition of \"Tell Me You Love Me\" from her 2017 record of the same name, accompanied by subtle, sparse keys. She continues her set with the title tracks from her recently-released studio album, Dancing With The Devil...The Art Of Starting Over. On both tracks, Lovato's voice feels stabilizing and grounding; there's a sense of clarity and purpose in its power.\n\nWhen interviewed by NPR's Ailsa Chang back in 2017, Demi Lovato said, \"I think I've lived a lot of life.\" Through both her struggles and successes, Lovato's shown all sides of herself – the confident and unapologetic star, but also the complexities of recovery – inviting us on her journey in a deeply personal way.

As Bryce is driven over the edge by his two most dangerous protectees, the trio get in over their heads in a global plot and soon find that they are all that stand between Europe and a vengeful and powerful madman (Antonio Banderas). Joining in the fun and deadly mayhem is Morgan Freeman as...well, you’ll have to see.\n\nLionsgate and Millennium Media present, a Millennium Media/Nu Boyana Film Studios production, in association with Campbell Grobman Films, and in association with Film i Vâst and Filmgate Films.",

As Bryce is driven over the edge by his two most dangerous protectees, the trio get in over their heads in a global plot and soon find that they are all that stand between Europe and a vengeful and powerful madman (Antonio Banderas). Joining in the fun and deadly mayhem is Morgan Freeman as...well, you’ll have to see.\n\nLionsgate and Millennium Media present, a Millennium Media/Nu Boyana Film Studios production, in association with Campbell Grobman Films, and in association with Film i Vâst and Filmgate Films."
