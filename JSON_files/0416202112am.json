Little did I know then that four years later Asa would be the one to OFFICIALLY propose to me... and I wouldn't have it ANY. OTHER.

        "description": "F9\nFast is back June 25.\nhttp://www.thefastsaga.com/\n\nNo matter how fast you are, no one outruns their past. \n\nF9 is the ninth chapter in the Fast & Furious Saga, which has endured for two decades and has earned more than $5 billion around the world.  \n\nVin Diesel’s Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he’s going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they’ve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom’s forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, the upcoming The Suicide Squad). \n\nF9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe—from London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tbilisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.  \n\nThe film stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron. F9 also features Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B as new franchise character Leysa, a woman with a connection to Dom’s past, and a cameo by Reggaeton sensation Ozuna.  \n\nF9 is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Joe Roth, Justin Lin, Clayton Townsend and Samantha Vincent.  www.thefastsaga.com",

        "description": "Today Architectural Digest brings you to Australia to visit Troye Sivan at his beautiful Melbourne home. Unpretentious yet expertly decorated, Troye collaborated with designer David Flack of local firm Flack Studio to bring the vision of his sunny, soulful home to life. An erstwhile brick factory and handball court, the property was transformed into a residence in 1970 by architect John Mockridge, preserving the essence of its Victorian-era origins. Today, it’s an eclectically decorated sanctuary - and a home for Troye’s artistic imagination.\r\n--\r\nAkari UF3-Q Lantern: https://fave.co/2Qs6ATQ\r\nSurface Mount Disc Orb: https://fave.co/3sgUydn\r\nChanneled Copper Velvet Pillow: https://fave.co/2QwzQZS\r\nSOLVINDEN LED Solar-Powered Pendant Lamp: https://fave.co/2Q4O448\r\nFlax Linen Sheet Set: https://fave.co/3uSFRyS\r\nEarth Fired Clay Herb Pot + Saucer: https://fave.co/3ae7c6q\r\nCopper Saucepan: https://fave.co/3snWtwF\r\n1909 Checkered Black and White 5 x 7 Area Rug Carpet: https://fave.co/3ae85Mv\r\nWhite Marble Mortar & Pestle: https://fave.co/2QmrPXb\r\nVintage Linen Bed Cover: https://fave.co/3gh2g4G\r\nStacking Patio Dining Armchair: https://fave.co/2RyQaJT\r\nCristobal Throw: https://fave.co/3djJyr7\r\nCallimaco Floor Lamp: https://fave.co/3afFPsR\r\nLucinda Terracotta Stacking Chair: https://fave.co/2OS8JrF\r\nCavallo Clay Bisque Tile: https://fave.co/3gi9JAv\r\nHoney Rattan Vase: https://fave.co/32hr6t3\r\nHigh Atlas Taznakht 3 Rug: https://fave.co/3geQMii\r\nShimmer Table: https://fave.co/3avPVpR\r\nSong Sofa: https://fave.co/3dlIinr\r\nTom Natural Three-Legged Coffee Table: https://fave.co/2RE4ktm\r\nUnited Strangers Misses Armchair: https://fave.co/3dq48GJ\r\nCantera Planter: https://fave.co/3sfK9P2\r\n\r\n--\r\nIntercolonial Handball Match.\r\nAuthor / Creator\r\nCalvert, Samuel, 1828-1913, engraver.\r\nSource: State Library Victoria.\r\n\r\nHandball: the intercolonial match.\r\nReproduction rights owned by the State Library of Victoria.\r\n\r\nFore more information on Hotels of Pyongyang, check out their Instagram Page:  Instagram handle is also @hotelsofnorthkorea : https://www.instagram.com/hotelsofnorthkorea/?hl=en \r\n\r\nSelect artwork by @hotelsofnorthkorea.\r\n\r\nArtworks by Jahnne Pasco-White, Nell, Tom Polo and Jahnne Pasco-White, courtesy the artists and STATION Australia.

          "description": "Today Architectural Digest brings you to Australia to visit Troye Sivan at his beautiful Melbourne home. Unpretentious yet expertly decorated, Troye collaborated with designer David Flack of local firm Flack Studio to bring the vision of his sunny, soulful home to life. An erstwhile brick factory and handball court, the property was transformed into a residence in 1970 by architect John Mockridge, preserving the essence of its Victorian-era origins. Today, it’s an eclectically decorated sanctuary - and a home for Troye’s artistic imagination.\r\n--\r\nAkari UF3-Q Lantern: https://fave.co/2Qs6ATQ\r\nSurface Mount Disc Orb: https://fave.co/3sgUydn\r\nChanneled Copper Velvet Pillow: https://fave.co/2QwzQZS\r\nSOLVINDEN LED Solar-Powered Pendant Lamp: https://fave.co/2Q4O448\r\nFlax Linen Sheet Set: https://fave.co/3uSFRyS\r\nEarth Fired Clay Herb Pot + Saucer: https://fave.co/3ae7c6q\r\nCopper Saucepan: https://fave.co/3snWtwF\r\n1909 Checkered Black and White 5 x 7 Area Rug Carpet: https://fave.co/3ae85Mv\r\nWhite Marble Mortar & Pestle: https://fave.co/2QmrPXb\r\nVintage Linen Bed Cover: https://fave.co/3gh2g4G\r\nStacking Patio Dining Armchair: https://fave.co/2RyQaJT\r\nCristobal Throw: https://fave.co/3djJyr7\r\nCallimaco Floor Lamp: https://fave.co/3afFPsR\r\nLucinda Terracotta Stacking Chair: https://fave.co/2OS8JrF\r\nCavallo Clay Bisque Tile: https://fave.co/3gi9JAv\r\nHoney Rattan Vase: https://fave.co/32hr6t3\r\nHigh Atlas Taznakht 3 Rug: https://fave.co/3geQMii\r\nShimmer Table: https://fave.co/3avPVpR\r\nSong Sofa: https://fave.co/3dlIinr\r\nTom Natural Three-Legged Coffee Table: https://fave.co/2RE4ktm\r\nUnited Strangers Misses Armchair: https://fave.co/3dq48GJ\r\nCantera Planter: https://fave.co/3sfK9P2\r\n\r\n--\r\nIntercolonial Handball Match.\r\nAuthor / Creator\r\nCalvert, Samuel, 1828-1913, engraver.\r\nSource: State Library Victoria.\r\n\r\nHandball: the intercolonial match.\r\nReproduction rights owned by the State Library of Victoria.\r\n\r\nFore more information on Hotels of Pyongyang, check out their Instagram Page:  Instagram handle is also @hotelsofnorthkorea : https://www.instagram.com/hotelsofnorthkorea/?hl=en \r\n\r\nSelect artwork by @hotelsofnorthkorea.\r\n\r\nArtworks by Jahnne Pasco-White, Nell, Tom Polo and Jahnne Pasco-White, courtesy the artists and STATION Australia.

        "description": "In Select Theaters May and on Netflix May 21.\n\nFrom filmmaker Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen, Zack Snyder’s Justice League), ARMY OF THE DEAD takes place following a zombie outbreak that has left Las Vegas in ruins and walled off from the rest of the world. When Scott Ward (Dave Bautista), a former zombie war hero who’s now flipping burgers on the outskirts of the town he now calls home, is approached by casino boss Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada), it’s with the ultimate proposition: break into the zombie-infested quarantine zone to retrieve $200 million sitting in a vault beneath the strip before the city is nuked by the government in 32 hours. With little left to lose, Ward takes on the challenge, assembling a ragtag team of experts for the heist. With a ticking clock, a notoriously impenetrable vault, and a smarter, faster horde of Alpha zombies closing in, only one thing’s for certain in the greatest heist ever attempted: survivors take all.\n\nStarring Dave Bautista, Ella Purnell, Omari Hardwick, Ana de la Reguera, Theo Rossi, Matthias Schweighöfer, Nora Arnezeder, Hiroyuki Sanada, Tig Notaro, Raúl Castillo, Huma Qureshi, Samantha Win, Michael Cassidy, Richard Cetrone, and Garret Dillahunt.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with 204 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages.
