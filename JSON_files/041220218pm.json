His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez.

        "description": "How centuries of division built one of the most unequal countries on earth.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nFor decades, South Africa was under apartheid: a series of laws that divided people by race. Then, in the 1990s, those laws were dismantled. But many of the barriers they created continue to divide South Africans by skin color - which in turn determines their quality of life, access to jobs, and wealth. Racial division was built into the fabric of cities throughout South Africa, and it still hasn't been uprooted.\n\nThat's partly because, while apartheid was the culmination of South Africa's racial divisions, it wasn't the beginning of them.

        "description": "Mining mobs in Minecraft brings a whole new challenge to the game! Thanks for all your comments! Keep em coming for future video ideas.\n\n✅ Get your AMONG US are Hats skinpack! ► https://cutt.ly/AmongUsAreHats\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO Comments to Crafting ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCExVkTyx3krvhmJjpFhb3dg?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nGet your They Are AMONG US skinpack! ► http://bit.ly/TheyAreAmongUs\nLogdotzip Games & Skinpacks here! ► https://cutt.ly/LogdotzipGames\nBecome a MEMBER today! ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D-GCxeE69hCUmRwISXABw/join\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nThis is Minecraft but you can mine mobs. First, you have to get cobblestone to turn into pebbles. These can be thrown at mobs to stun them so you can mine them. After you mine three of a mob, you can turn them into a pickaxe. The chicken pickaxe lets you float to the ground instead of falling, while the sheep pickaxe drops wool everytime you mine. The villager pickaxe gives you Hero of the Village and amazing trades and the spider pickaxe even lets you climb walls. Of course, as you advance, you need stronger materials to stun mobs. While pebbles may work on passive mobs, coal is needed for neutral mobs, iron for hostile mobs, and even diamond for some of the strongest mobs. These stronger mobs include the Iron Golem, whose pickaxe launches whatever you attack, and the Ravager, whose pickaxe has a roar attack. Even the Ender Dragon can be turned into a pickaxe, which will mine any blocks you walk towards. Which pickaxe was your favorite? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nMinecraft but you can Mine mobs\n\n#Mining #Minecraft #Mobs\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nMy YouTube Channels: SUBSCRIBE 🔔 AND CLICK THE BELL!\nSUBSCRIBE TO Comments to Crafting ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCExVkTyx3krvhmJjpFhb3dg?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nSUBSCRIBE TO Logdotzip ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D-GCxeE69hCUmRwISXABw?sub_confirmation=1\nSUBSCRIBE TO Logdotzip PE ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjohKw_BBprzQ23M_5hXrZg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nHang out with Logdotzip!\n\nFan Discord ► http://discord.gg/logdotzip\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nMy Social Media:\n📰 Facebook ► http://facebook.com/Logdotzip\n💬 Twitter ► http://twitter.com/Logdotzip\n📸 Instagram ► http://instagram.com/Logdotzip\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\n🎶 Music courtesy of Epidemic Sound\nAll music used with permission from its creator.",

First, you have to get cobblestone to turn into pebbles. These can be thrown at mobs to stun them so you can mine them. After you mine three of a mob, you can turn them into a pickaxe. The chicken pickaxe lets you float to the ground instead of falling, while the sheep pickaxe drops wool everytime you mine. The villager pickaxe gives you Hero of the Village and amazing trades and the spider pickaxe even lets you climb walls. Of course, as you advance, you need stronger materials to stun mobs. While pebbles may work on passive mobs, coal is needed for neutral mobs, iron for hostile mobs, and even diamond for some of the strongest mobs. These stronger mobs include the Iron Golem, whose pickaxe launches whatever you attack, and the Ravager, whose pickaxe has a roar attack. Even the Ender Dragon can be turned into a pickaxe, which will mine any blocks you walk towards. Which pickaxe was your favorite? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nMinecraft but you can Mine mobs\n\n#Mining #Minecraft #Mobs\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nMy YouTube Channels: SUBSCRIBE 🔔 AND CLICK THE BELL!\nSUBSCRIBE TO Comments to Crafting ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCExVkTyx3krvhmJjpFhb3dg?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nSUBSCRIBE TO Logdotzip ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D-GCxeE69hCUmRwISXABw?sub_confirmation=1\nSUBSCRIBE TO Logdotzip PE ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjohKw_BBprzQ23M_5hXrZg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nHang out with Logdotzip!\n\nFan Discord ► http://discord.gg/logdotzip\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nMy Social Media:\n📰 Facebook ► http://facebook.com/Logdotzip\n💬 Twitter ► http://twitter.com/Logdotzip\n📸 Instagram ► http://instagram.com/Logdotzip\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\n🎶 Music courtesy of Epidemic Sound\nAll music used with permission from its creator."
